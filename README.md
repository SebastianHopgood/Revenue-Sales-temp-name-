# 🚀 Olist 360: E-Commerce End-to-End Business Intelligence (EDA)

## 📋 Overview
The project analyzes a real-world Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at the Olist Store, containing approximately 100,000 orders between 2016 and 2018. The dataset is structured across 9 relational tables covering customers, orders, locations, products, categories, sellers, and reviews, enabling a full view of the end-to-end e-commerce process from purchase to delivery and customer feedback

The goal of the project is to simulate a real business scenario by developing an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to visualize business answers along with an executive summary on how to improve the business. To support this, raw CSV data was imported and integrated into SQL using Excel, BigQuery datasets were created and changed within SQL using DML and DDL, then cleaned and transformed using SQL processes, and multiple tables were joined together to create a star schema for analysis. The cleaned datasets were connected to Power BI, where an interactive dashboard was built and used to help develop the perfect executive insight presentation

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary goal is to provide a 360-degree view of the Olist Store to measure preformance, increase operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and develop a selling strategy. Stakeholders requested to know:
* Sales Performance: Which product categories drive the most revenue and how is sales volumne trending over time?
* Logistics & Delivery: What is the average delivery time across different Brazilian states and where are the most significant shipping delays?
* Customer Experience: How does shipping performance (late vs on-time) directly impact customer review scores?
* Seller Strategy: Which sellers are the top performers and which regions have the highest concentration of active customers?

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* Excel: Used for initial data inspection, metadata documentation, and as a bridge to import raw CSV files into the SQL environment
* SQL (BigQuery): The backbone of the project. Used for DDL, DML, DQL, data cleaning, performing complex multi-table joins, and developing ETL pipelines to create a structured Star Schema
* Power BI: Used to build an interactive, multi-page dashboard. Leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures for KPIs, time intelligence, and visualizations
* GitHub/Git: Utilized for project documentation, version control of code scripts, and hosting the portfolio
* Vs Code: Joined with Git to control project codes files

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### ASK
* **Define the Project Goal:** The primary goal is to provide a 360-degree view of the Olist Store to measure performance, increase operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and develop a selling strategy

* **Define the Stakeholders:** Olist CEO and Logistics Department

* **Ask SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) Questions to Identify Business Problems/Needs:**

* Sales: Identify the top 5 product categories by total revenue and calculate their Month-over-Month (MoM) growth between 2016 and 2018
* Logistics: Determine the average lead time in days for each Brazilian state and identify regions where the average exceeds the estimated delivery date
* Satisfaction: Quantify the correlation coefficient between shipping delays (Actual vs. Estimated) and average review scores (1-5)
* Strategy: Identify sellers in the top 10% by sales volume and map the geographic density of customers to find unserved high-demand regions

* **Develop A SOW (Scope of Work)**:
* SOW is created in order to give stakeholders a clear outline of the project which includes: project overview, scope, out-of-scope, project deliverables and files, key project milestones, and an estimated timeline for each milestone and project completion. Link to SOW PDF: "add link"
